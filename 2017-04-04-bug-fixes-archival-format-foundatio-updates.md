## Let's Get Down To Business

### Updates to Exceptionless

* We fixed an issue where you couldn't run Exceptionless on AWS because you couldn't install plugins on their ElasticSearch service. _[#280](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues/280)_

* The archival format has also been change from `projected\year\month\day` to `year\month\day\hour\projectid`. This allows you to quickly restore or download all events in a time period without enumerating all backed up projects.

### Foundatio Updates

* In Foundatio, we fixed an issue where Redis Queues could deadlock, causing them to stop processing. This was being caused from topic messages locking the calling thread.

### Updates to Foundatio Repositories

* GetById and GetByIds now take an Id Type which allows us to specify routing information and much more. We have an implicit conversion that handles existing signatures.
