</div>
<p>Blake’s been busy lately, including some work on one of our other projects, <a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/product/generator">CodeSmith Generator</a>, to update Exceptionless to the latest version. Naturally, this got him thinking about other potential improvements while we were doing work on Serilog Sink for Exceptionless and Foundatio.Redis, as well.</p>

<h2>CodeSmith Generator Gets Latest Exceptionless Update</h2>
<p>While updating our WPF application, <a href="http://www.codesmithtools.com/product/generator">CodeSmith Generator</a>, to the latest version of Exceptionless, Blake brainstorms several improvements that could be made to help take advantage of plugins, isolate Exceptionless from other plugins, etc.</p>
<h2>Serilog Sink</h2>
<p>There was an issue that was breaking the ability to update to the latest version of Exceptionless. This has now been fixed.</p>
<h2>Foundatio.Redis Update</h2>
<p>Deserialization wasn’t working properly with binary serializers, but the issue has been resolved.</p>
