When we started developing Exceptionless 2.0, we knew it was one of the major features we wanted to include.</p>
<p>We couldn’t just throw in a string search and hope for the best. We had to build it in a way that let users perform basic and advanced filtering, easily, with fast and streamlined results.</p>
<p><strong>Enter Exceptionless filtering and searching.</strong> You can filter by organization, project, multiple time frame selectors, and specific event variables (with modifiers).</p>
<p>Watch the video below for a quick test drive, and read further down the page for more details and links!<!--more--></p>

<h2>Filter by Organization &amp; Project</h2>
<p><a href="/_site/assets/filter-by-project-organization.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13047" style="margin-left: 20px;" src="/_site/assets/filter-by-project-organization-300x208.png" alt="Exceptionless Organizations and Projects" width="300" height="208" data-id="13047" srcset="https://exceptionless.com/assets/filter-by-project-organization-300x208.png 300w, https://exceptionless.com/assets/filter-by-project-organization.png 593w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>By default, the dashboard loads up with all projects selected.</p>
<p>To show only data from a specific organization or project within an organization, simply click on the “All Projects” drop down in the top left of the dashboard and select your organization or project.</p>
<p>Whatever view you are in will then be transformed to display only data from that organization/project.</p>
<p>To change it back to all projects, simply select the drop down again and click on “All Projects.”</p>
<h2>Filter by Time Frame</h2>
<p><a href="/_site/assets/filter-by-timeframe.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-13048" style="margin-left: 20px;" src="/_site/assets/filter-by-timeframe-300x205.png" alt="Exceptionles Time Frame Filters" width="300" height="205" data-id="13048" srcset="https://exceptionless.com/assets/filter-by-timeframe-300x205.png 300w, https://exceptionless.com/assets/filter-by-timeframe.png 675w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Exceptionless offers multiple preset time frame options, as well as the ability to customize the time frame down to the second.</p>
<p>To select your time frame of choice, click on the calendar icon next to the project drop down on the top navigation bar of your dashboard.</p>
<p>Once there, you can select “Last Hour,” “Last 24 Hours,” “Last Week,” “Last 30 Days,” “All Time,” or “Custom.”</p>
<p>Most of these options are pretty self explanatory, but if you click on “Custom,” a popup will appear that lets you select the start and end date, as well as start and end hours, minutes, and seconds of those dates.</p>
<p>Another way to control the data time frame is to simply select a period of time on the history graph itself by clicking, dragging, and releasing. This will automatically update the custom time frame points and refresh the data to match that period.</p>
<h2>Filter and Search by Specific Criteria</h2>
<p><a href="/_site/assets/filter-by-search-filter-criteria.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignright wp-image-13063 size-medium" style="margin-left: 20px;" src="/_site/assets/filter-by-search-filter-criteria-300x203.png" alt="Exceptionless Search Filter Feature" width="300" height="203" data-id="13049" srcset="https://exceptionless.com/assets/filter-by-search-filter-criteria-300x203.png 300w, https://exceptionless.com/assets/filter-by-search-filter-criteria.png 774w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a>Being able to search your errors and events by specific criteria is, perhaps, the largest improvement for version 2.0.</p>
<p>By selecting the magnifying glass icon next to the calendar icon in the top navigation, you can enter <a title="Exceptionless Search Filter Documentation" href="http://docs.exceptionless.com/contents/search/" target="_blank">search criteria</a> and select whether you want the results to include fixed and/or hidden events/errors.</p>
<p>You can filter by tag, ID, organization, project, stack, type, value, IP, architecture, user, and much much more. Some searches, such as ID, require a prefix (“id:”) on the search, but others, such as error.message, can be entered as strings (“A NullReferenceException occurred”). View a complete list of searchable terms, examples, and FAQs on our <a title="Exceptionless Search Documentation" href="http://docs.exceptionless.com/contents/search/" target="_blank">Searching Documentation Page</a>.</p>
