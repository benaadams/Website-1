<h2>Blake Speaks @ North Dallas .NET</h2>
<p>On May 3, Blake spoke at the <a href="http://northdallas.net/">North Dallas .NET User Group</a> meetup in Plano. The topic was Exception Driven Development, and of course he killed it! Naturally, the Exceptionless love was shared to all.</p>
<h2>Exceptionless &amp; Foundatio.Repositories Updates</h2>
<p>For Exceptionless, we worked on upgrading the email templates to use Zurb for emails and handlebars. We also fixed an issue where you could only log in 15 times in a 15 minute time period.</p>
<p>For Foundatio.Repositories, <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio.Repositories/commit/86c1539a9fdb12880db9a4fba1dccdc27055ccea">query if (FieldEqualsIf) support</a> has been added.</p>
