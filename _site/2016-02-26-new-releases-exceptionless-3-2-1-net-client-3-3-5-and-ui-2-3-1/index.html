<p><strong>Upgrading:</strong> Only self-hosters need to worry about upgrading – see details on the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/releases/tag/v3.2.1" target="_blank">full release notes.</a></p>
<h2>Exceptionless.NET 3.3.3 – 3.3.6</h2>
<p>We’ve pushed out several minor releases of the .NET client in the last few weeks. I’ll cover the major stuff here, but you can view the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.Net/releases" target="_blank">full release notes and get the latest source on GitHub</a>.</p>
<h3>3.3.6</h3>
<ul>
<li>An issue causing query string params and cookies to be renamed when dictionary key names were being changed has been fixed.</li>
<li><code>client.Register()</code> now respects your session setting.</li>
<li>Manual stacking now uses a model instead of a string, which lets us send a stack title and key value pairs telling the event how to be stacked. More info on the release page.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you are using manual stacking</strong>, this is a required update. <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.Net/releases/tag/v3.3.6" target="_blank">See the release page for the latest source.</a></p>
<h3>3.3.5</h3>
<ul>
<li>New extension methods have been added for events, making it easier to set valid geo coordinates, tags, and more.</li>
<li>A few new variables and parameters have been added for session heartbeats and id setting. See release notes for details.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/InlineAsm" target="_blank">@InlineASM</a> fixed an issue for geolocations that have different separators – thanks!</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.3.4</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/ahmettaha" target="_blank">@ahmettaha</a> added SubmitLog and CreateLog overloads without source parameters. Thanks!</li>
<li><code>ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.UseDebugLogger()</code> only worked in debug mode with client source, so we replaced it with <code>ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.UseInMemoryLogger()</code></li>
<li>The serializer wasn’t always being passed through so it could get known event data helper methods, which was causing some silent failures – this has been fixed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.3.3</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/adamzolotarev" target="_blank">@adamzolotarev</a> added the ability to take complete control over how an event is stacked (be careful) by adding the ability to do manual stacking by calling <code>EventBuilder.SetManualStackingKey(&quot;MyStackingKey&quot;)</code></li>
<li>You can now ignore events by user agent bot filter when you call <code>(ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.AddUserAgentBotPatterns(&quot;*bot*&quot;))</code> on the client side or edit project settings server side.</li>
<li>The default max size limit of <code>RequestInfo</code> has been increased.</li>
<li>Extra nesting has been reduced by merging <code>exception.Data</code> properties into the <code>Error.Data</code> dictionary.</li>
<li>Bug Fix: <code>AggregatedExceptiones</code> that contain more than one inner exception are no longer discarded.</li>
<li>Bug Fix: Machines with a Non-English locale will not process events when <code>SetGeo</code> is used.</li>
<li>Bug Fix: <code>ArgumentNullException</code> will no longer be thrown if post data or cookies contain a null key.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Exceptionless.JavaScript 1.3.2</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/frankebersoll" target="_blank">@frankebersoll</a> contributed by adding support for offline storage, which can be enabled by calling <code>client.config.useLocalStorage()</code>. Thanks!</li>
<li>User agent bots can be ignored via a filter now with <code>(`client.config.addUserAgentBotPatterns(&quot;bot&quot;))</code> on the client side or via project settings on the server side.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/frankebersoll" target="_blank">@frankebersoll</a> also added support for manual stacking (be careful! grants complete control). See release notes for instructions.</li>
<li>The implementation of the angular <code>$stateChangeError</code> has also been improved.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/releases/tag/v1.3.2" target="_blank">Full release notes</a></p>
<h2>Exceptionless.UI 2.3.1</h2>
<p>There’s nothing major to report with the UI, just a few tweaks.</p>
<ul>
<li>The project settings pages has been reworked by adding the ability to specify user namespaces, and user agents that the clients will ignore. @VikzSharma also fixed an issue where the single page app could be clickjacked – thanks again!</li>
</ul>
