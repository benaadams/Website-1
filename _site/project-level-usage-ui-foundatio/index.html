<p>We’ve snuck in lots of updates for this past week! New features have been added, such as collecting project-level usage statistics, the ability to add notes to API keys, and much more. Oh, and we’re no longer throttling free plans! That’s for Exceptionless core, but we’ve also made updates  to the Exceptionless UI and Foundatio core, Foundatio.Repositories, and Foundatio.Parsers. Check everything out, below.<!--more--></p>
