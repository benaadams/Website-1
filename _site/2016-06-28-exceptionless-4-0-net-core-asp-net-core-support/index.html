<h1>Exceptionless.NET 4.0 &#8211; .NET Core and ASP.NET Core Support!</h1>

<p>That’s right folks, with the release of Exceptionless.NET 4.0 you can now build .NET applications with Exceptionless on Linux, MacOS, and Windows!</p>
<p>We’ve added .NET Core, ASP.NET Core, and .NET Standard 1.2+ support.</p>
<p>We know many of you have been waiting for this, and it’s been a long time coming, but we sat down, put in the hours, and made it happen for you guys!</p>

<!--more-->The NuGet package now supports .NET Standard 1.2+, PCL Profile 151, and .NET 4.5.
<p><strong>To make upgrading easy</strong>, the <code>Exceptionless.Portable</code> NuGet package still exists and is dependent on the <code>Exceptionless</code> Package.</p>
<p>If .NET 4.0 is a requirement for your projects, you will need to continue using the Exceptionless.NET v3.5 NuGet Packages, which are not being deprecated.</p>
<p>As a matter of housekeeping, we removed the <code>ExceptionlessClient.Current</code> property, which was replaced with <code>ExceptionlessClient.Default</code> in v2.0.0, and the configuration <code>EnableSSL</code> properties (also depracated in v2).</p>
<h2>Upgrading</h2>
<p>Updating the NuGet packages should be all you need to do if you are upgrading from Exceptionless.NET v2 or v3. Take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.Net/wiki/Upgrading">upgrade guide</a> if you have any questions.</p>
