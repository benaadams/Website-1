<p>If you’ve been following along the last few weeks, you know we’ve been working hard to get the new <a href="http://exceptionless.com/javascript-client-available-for-preview-testing/" target="_blank">JavaScript Client</a> up to speed and ready for a version 1 release.</p>
<p><strong>We think we’re there!</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re a <a href="http://exceptionless.com/javascript-client-demo-exceptionless/" target="_blank">JavaScript</a> or <a href="http://exceptionless.com/exceptionless-node-js-javascript-client-demo/" target="_blank">Node.js</a> user, you’ll be able to enjoy the same full featured exception and event reporting platform that our primary .NET client offers, with fewer platform specific boundaries.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Sure It’s Ready?</h2>
<p>We have been doing extensive testing over the course of the last month, which has allowed us to identify issues and inefficiencies throughout. Each of those has been addressed with several improvements and fixes, leaving us with a much faster, more stable client.</p>
<p>Many of the tweaks we made were related to IE9 and Node. Those issues have been resolved and things are working well now. In addition, we further increased performance by shrinking the library size fairly drastically.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we will just be working on bug fixes related to user-reported issues as usage picks up.</p>
<h3>Recent Bug Fixes, Issue Resolutions, &amp; Improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ensured compatibility with module formats like <a href="http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:specification_drafts" target="_blank">es6</a> (<a href="https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs" target="_blank">SystemJS</a>/<a href="http://jspm.io/" target="_blank">jspm</a>) and <a href="http://requirejs.org/" target="_blank">RequireJS</a></li>
<li>Various IE9 and Node compatibility issues fixed</li>
