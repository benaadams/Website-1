<h1>Fork Us! Exceptionless Goes Open Source</h1>

<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright  wp-image-2845" alt="Octocat" src="http://exceptionless.com/assets/Octocat-300x249.png" width="240" height="199" data-id="2845" srcset="https://exceptionless.com/assets/Octocat-300x249.png 300w, https://exceptionless.com/assets/Octocat.png 800w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px" />It’s a big day at Exceptionless.</strong></p>
<p>We are super excited to announce that we are <a title="Exceptionless on GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless" target="_blank">open sourcing the Exceptionless code</a>! That’s right, now you can hack on our real-time error reporting tool yourself.</p>
<p>Too many apps are throwing too many errors out there, resulting in confused users, lost business, and endless frustration.</p>
<p>We believe Exceptionless can help the development community become more in-tune with their code by making those errors more transparent, trackable, and squashable. More importantly, we want to support developers building and shipping better code for their <strong>users</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why Open Source?</h2>
<p>In short, we want to see what the community can do with our baby, which we consider a great development tool. The open source movement has provided innovation throughout the industry, and we cannot tell you how excited we are to be a part of it.</p>
<p>We hope you will take it, add to it, suggest great new features, and report bugs, but most of all we hope you will use it to <strong>build better apps for the world</strong>.</p>
<p>The Exceptionless Team will continue to work on a road map of features and improvements, all while providing support to developers that want to contribute.</p>
<h3>Planned features/enhancements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Refactor client so that the base client is a PCL library thus supporting WinRT and Mono.</li>
<li>Implement search features using ElasticSearch.</li>
<li>JavaScript client for reporting client side errors.</li>
<li>Refactor the API and UI to be completely separate layers and rewrite the UI as a SPA app using AngularJS.</li>
<li>Add a server side plugin system that allows new functionality to be easily added like HipChat notifications.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ideas for the community</h3>
<p>These include just a few of feature requests, etc, that aren’t in the team’s immediate pipeline that you might consider tackling.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clients for Ruby, Java, Python, PHP, etc</li>
<li>Ability to log non-exception data</li>
<li>Teams within organizations</li>
<li>Bookmarks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lets make something awesome</h3>
<p>We have spent a lot of time on Exceptionless, but together with the community we can take it to the next level. Check out the <a title="Exceptionless on GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> today, and happy coding!</p>
<p><strong>Watch out, exceptions!</strong></p>
