<p>As you guys know, we’ve been working on <a href="/email-notification-improvements-walkthrough-and-details/">notification improvements</a> lately. This latest video update by Blake is no different and involves <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> integration!<!--more--></p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with Slack, definitely check it out. It’s a great app for communicating with your team, and much more. For Exceptionless, it’s been something we’ve wanted to integrate closely with for a while now, because email can be very tedious and overwhelming. With Slack integration, you can set up a specific channel for your Exceptionless notifications to go to, and have an organized eye on your events.</p>
<p>Watch the video above for an explanation of the integration, and see below on how to set it up for yourself.</p>
<h2>Set up Slack Notifications for Exceptionless</h2>
<p>First, go into your project’s settings in the Exceptionless app and click on the Integrations tab.</p>

<p>Then, click on “Add Slack Notifications” and log in to your slack team.</p>
<p>Once logged in, you will need to select the channel you want Exceptionless Notifications to post to and click Authorize.</p>
<p>Once authorized, you can then configure the different notification settings by going back to the Exceptionless app and into the project’s integrations tab again.</p>

<p>Once integrated and configured, notifications will look something like the below screenshot, with the message, type of event, stack trace, links to actions, etc.</p>

<p>We’re excited to keep improving notifications, and would love for you guys to test this out for us.</p>
<p>Integrations with other chat &amp; productivity tools like Hipchat and Microsoft Teams are on our list, as well, so if you use these please ping us and let us know so we can gauge interest!</p>
