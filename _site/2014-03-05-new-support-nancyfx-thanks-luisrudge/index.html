<h2>What’s NancyFX?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>“Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Buit from the ground up (not simply a DSL on another framework)</li>
<li>Removed underlying framework limitations and feature hacks</li>
<li>Removed need to reference assemblies you don’t need, keeping things light</li>
<li>Ability to run anywhere, including ASP.NET/IIS, WCF, self hosted, and any OWIN out of the box</li>
<li>Super lightweight action declarations for GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS and PATCH requests</li>
<li>View engine integration for Spark, Razor, dotLiquid, SuperSimpleViewEngine, and others</li>
<li>Request path matching with advanced parameter capabilities, plus the ability to replace the path matching strategy with custom implementations for your needs</li>
<li>Easy response syntax, enabling you to return things like int, string, HttpStatusCode and Action elements without having to explicitly cast or wrap your response – you just return it and Nancy will do the work for you</li>
<li>A powerful, light-weight, testing framework to help you verify the behavior of your application</li>
<li>Content negotiation</li>
<li>And more…</li>
</ul>
