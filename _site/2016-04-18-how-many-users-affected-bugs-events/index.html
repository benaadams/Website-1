<h1>Know How Many Users are Affected by Bugs and Events</h1>

<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class="alignright size-full wp-image-14327" src="http://exceptionless.com/assets/users-featured-image.png" alt="exceptionless user tracking" width="260" height="260" data-id="14327" srcset="https://exceptionless.com/assets/users-featured-image.png 260w, https://exceptionless.com/assets/users-featured-image-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px" />Prioritizing your bug fixes and development time</strong> in general can be a daunting task.</p>
<p>Sometimes, as developers, <strong>we want to work on this shiny widget</strong> or this annoying bug, and we don’t really have anything in our face telling us to <strong>quit focusing on our dreams</strong> and work on what matters to the bottom line.</p>
<p>I can hear you over there: <strong>“But, my dreams are important!”</strong> Well, yes, but you don’t get to have fun working on those until you’ve made your <strong>users</strong> happy by fixing the bugs that are affecting the majority of them or expanding on that feature that they are all using every single time they use your app.</p>
<p>We’ve got something that will let you get those pesky tasks off your plate though, so you can move on to the fun stuff!</p>

<h2>Who and How Bad Is It?</h2>
<p>Our new “users” column and “Most Users” dashboard lets you <strong>know exactly what percentage of your users are being affected by events or using features</strong>. This allows you to prioritize the most important bugs or features to work on right away and potentially backlog things that only a few users are having issues with or using.</p>
<p>Of course, you’ll need to be sending at least a user id (and preferably a display name) for each user. We’ll cover how to do that later in the article.</p>
<h3>Percentage of Users Column</h3>
<p>The new Users column on your Exceptionless dashboard displays a percentage value for each event stack that represents the number of users that have been affected by the event or, if it is a feature, that have used the feature.</p>
<p>If you mouse over the percentage, you can see the number of users the percentage represents out of the total.</p>
<p>These numbers are dynamically calculated for your selected timeframe that you are currently viewing.</p>

<h3>Most Users Dashboard</h3>
<p>Because the main dashboard shows you the most frequent events, not necessarily with the highest usage, <strong>we thought it would be helpful to have a new dashboard that automatically sorts event stacks by the percentage of users affected,</strong> letting you start at the top of an exception list, for example, and work your way down knowing you’re always working on a bug, etc, that is affecting the highest percentage of users.</p>

<h2>Setting User Identity</h2>
<p>In order to assure you are getting value out of the user feature, you want to make sure you are setting the user. For Exceptionless to track a user for your app, you need to send a user identity with each event. To do so, you need to set the default user identity via the following client methods:</p>
<h4>C#</h4>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">using Exceptionless;
ExceptionlessClient.Default.Configuration.SetUserIdentity("UNIQUE_ID_OR_EMAIL_ADDRESS", "Display Name");</pre>
<h4>JavaScript</h4>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">exceptionless.ExceptionlessClient.default.config.setUserIdentity('UNIQUE_ID_OR_EMAIL_ADDRESS', 'Display Name');</pre>
<p>Once the user is set on the config object, it will be applied to all future events.</p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> In WinForms and WPF applications, a plugin will automatically set the default user to the <code>&lt;strong&gt;Environment.UserName&lt;/strong&gt;</code> if the default user hasn’t been already set. Likewise, if you are in a web environment, we will set the default user to the request principal’s identity if the default user hasn’t already been set.</p>
<h3>ASP.NET Example</h3>
<p>You can also manually set the user info on the event directly. This is intended for **multi-user processes (web applications)<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/slack-free-unlimited-plan-has-limits-2015-6">.</a> **For most MVC and WebAPI packages, the user will be set automatically based on the logged in principal, so you don’t have to do anything.</p>
<pre class="brush: csharp; title: ; notranslate" title="">// Import the exceptionless namespace.
using Exceptionless;

ExceptionlessClient.Default.CreateFeatureUsage("MyFeature").SetUserIdentity(“123456789", “Blake Niemyjski").Submit();
</pre>
<h3>JavaScript Example</h3>
<p>If you’re using the JavaScript client, the entire session of the client will typically be for a single user, so you should be able to set it one time when they log in to your app.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">exceptionless.ExceptionlessClient.default.setUserIdentity("id", "friendly name")`
</pre>
<p>Like with .NET, if you are running a multi-user process (Node.js), you’ll need to set the user at the event level.</p>
<pre class="brush: jscript; title: ; notranslate" title="">// javascript
var client = exceptionless.ExceptionlessClient.default;
// Node.Js
// var client = require('exceptionless').ExceptionlessClient.default;

client.createFeatureUsage('MyFeature’).setUserIdentity('123456789', 'Blake Niemyjski').submit();
</pre>
<h2>How Will You Use this Data</h2>
<p>We are always interested in how our users use our features, and if our users feature helps our users help their users, well, that’s a win win for our users and their users. Go users!</p>
<p>Don’t forget to stop by and let us know if you love or hate it, and of course let us know if you think we can improve on anything within Exceptionless.</p>
