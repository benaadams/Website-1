<p><strong>Last week, Elasticsearch <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/being-exceptionless-with-elasticsearch" target="_blank">published that case study on their blog</a></strong>, so we wanted to make sure our readers had a chance to check it out!</p>
<p>We’ve written about our use of Elasticsearch in numerous articles before, including:<!--more--></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>In the case study</strong>, we discuss how Elasticsearch let us improve our real-time dashboard, work with time zones more easily, index data much faster, not have to worry so much about pre-aggregating data, maintain much less code, improve backup and restoration, shrink disk space usage, and, perhaps most importantly, drastically improve scalability.</p>
<p>Basically, <strong>we really like Elasticsearch</strong> and you should check it out if you haven’t already.</p>
