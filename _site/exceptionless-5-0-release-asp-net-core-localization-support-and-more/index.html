<p><a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless">Exceptionless</a> 5.0 is here and we wanted to make a quick blog post highlighting the new features, bug fixes, and of course upgrading.</p>
<p>In this release, we focused primarily on migrating the application to ASP.NET Core, localization, along with ongoing performance enhancements and bug fixes.</p>
<p>More details, below:<!--more--></p>
<h2>Exceptionless 5.0 New Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>Exceptionless now runs on ASP.NET Core! This brings in many performance advantages as well as cross platform support.</li>
<li>Docker/Kubernetes based hosting is now the default hosting model. This will bring seamless and quick upgrades while reducing the amount of environmental related errors.</li>
<li>Added Chinese localization support. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/Varorbc">@Varorbc</a>, <a href="https://github.com/edwardmeng">@edwardmeng</a> for that contribution!</li>
<li>Added support for using various different cloud hosted services (e.g., Aliyun, Minio, S3) and metric providers (e.g., InfluxDB). Thanks <a href="https://github.com/edwardmeng">@edwardmeng</a> for that contribution!</li>
<li>When viewing 404 event types, you will now see a grid column for IP addresses. This will allow you to quickly identify any bots or security scans that might be happening to your applications.</li>
<li>In addition to client side plugins that will remove sensitive user data, we’ve added server side code as well to remove any missed sensitive user data.</li>
<li>Added the ability to delete your account on the manage account page.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Version 5.0 Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Various user interface usability issues have been fixed in this release. Please view the UI release notes (<a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.UI/releases/tag/v2.8.0">v2.8.0</a> for more info).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where notifications and web hooks would be sent for fixed events.</li>
<li>Updated <a href="https://github.com/FoundatioFx/Foundatio">Foundatio</a> which uses a task queue to resolve dead locking and thread exhaustion.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrading to Exceptionless 5.0</h2>
<p>If you are using our hosted service, you do not need to upgrade anything on your end. If you are self hosting Exceptionless and upgrading from version 4 or 5, a little work is needed to get up and running using the new docker images and configuration. See our <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/wiki/Upgrading">upgrade guide</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/releases/tag/v5.0.0">official release notes</a> here, or view the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/compare/v4.1.0...v5.0.0">full changelog</a> if you are interested in a complete list of changes.</p>
