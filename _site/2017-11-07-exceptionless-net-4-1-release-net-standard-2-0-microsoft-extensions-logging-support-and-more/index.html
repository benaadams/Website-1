<p>More details, below:<!--more--></p>
<h2>Exceptionless.NET 4.1 New Features</h2>
<ol>
<li>We’ve added .NET Standard 2.0 support, which allows you to easily integrate with UWP applications now.</li>
<li>Microsoft.Extensions.Logging support has also been added via the Exceptionless.Extensions.Logging client. Thank you <a href="https://github.com/moogle001">@moogle001</a> for contributing to this feature!</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jamierushton">@jamierushton</a>, we now allow <code>null</code> and <code>default</code> values to be serialized, which translates to greater insight into contextual data.</li>
<li>We’re now using <a href="https://github.com/GitTools/GitLink">GitLink</a> to debug packages more easily.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Version 4.1 Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>GetFiles has been replaced with the EnumerateFiles method to improve performance in FolderObjectStorage. Thanks <a href="https://github.com/edwardmeng">@edwardmeng</a> for that contribution!</li>
<li>@edwardmeng also helped us improve diangnostic logging by including timestamps and log level. Thanks again!</li>
</ul>
