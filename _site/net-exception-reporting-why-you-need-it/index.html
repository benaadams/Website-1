<p>We have all worked on projects, large and small, where tiny, one-off bugs went unnoticed for <em>a while</em> before they were finally reported by a user or discovered by a developer. In some instances, these bugs probably affected the end-user’s ability to use the service, purchase an item, etc, meaning that there was a direct impact on the bottom line.</p>
<p>What if you didn’t have to worry about .NET exceptions going unnoticed anymore?<!--more--></p>
<h2>Enter real-time .NET exception reporting</h2>

<p>What .NET developers needed was a tool that focused on error reporting by logging, grouping, and sending notifications. They needed flexibility through custom objects and a fluent API. They needed every error detail presented in a organized, readable manner. The even needed charts that clearly showed their progress in squashing the tens, hundreds, or thousands of daily exceptions that they didn’t know they were occurring.</p>
<p>We needed all that, too, so <strong>we built a tool that does it all for us!</strong></p>
<h3>What a .NET exception reporting tool has up its sleeves</h3>
<p>When we set out to build Exceptionless, we went through hundreds of possible features, and even toyed with building a larger product that including other functionality, but in the end we decided we wanted it to do the following things really well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Send error <strong>notifications</strong></li>
<li><strong>Group exceptions</strong> intelligently into stacks</li>
<li><strong>Show top errors</strong> and allow them to be <strong>prioritized</strong></li>
<li>Provide <strong>detailed error reports</strong>, including <strong>stacktrace</strong></li>
<li>Have a <strong>dashboard</strong> with an immediate view of error statistics and trends</li>
<li>Allow <strong>custom objects</strong> to be added to reports</li>
<li>Allow <strong>unlimited users</strong> per organization</li>
<li>Give developers a way to **mark exceptions critical, fixed, or **<strong>monitor for regressions</strong></li>
<li>Provide <strong>real-time updates</strong>, as exceptions happen</li>
<li><strong>Support offline usability</strong> in scenarios where the developer is traveling, etc</li>
<li>Be able to be <strong>installed in less than 5 minutes</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Exceptionless is a must-try for .NET developers</h3>
<p><strong>You should give it a shot if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finding that bug 2 weeks sooner could have saved you or your company a lot of money</li>
<li>Customers were lost because of a bug on production that you couldn’t see locally or in the development environment</li>
<li>You fixed a bug in one spot, only to find out that it was happening in several other places as well</li>
<li>There might be errors here or there, but they probably aren’t affecting very many users <em>(hint: they probably are)</em>.</li>
<li>You or your team are making a lot of changes in the next sprint, and you really want to make sure you know when a bug gets introduced</li>
<li><em>and the list goes on…</em></li>
</ul>
