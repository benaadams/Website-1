#Filing issues</p>
<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> GitHub is for bug reports and code contributions only - if you have a support question or a request for a customisation don't post here, go to our <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wordpress-seo">Support Forum</a> instead.</p>
<p>For localization, please refer to <a href="http://translate.yoast.com/projects/wordpress-seo">translate.yoast.com</a>, though bugs with strings that can't be translated are welcome here.</p>
<h2>How to write a useful bug report</h2>
<p>If you think you have found a bug (we acknowledge that that's a possibility), please make sure you're using the latest version of the plugin. If possible check out the latest version from GitHub and see if the bug still exists there.</p>
<p>A useful bug report explains:</p>
<ol>
<li>What you were trying to achieve.</li>
<li>What you were expecting to happen.</li>
<li>What actually happened, illustrated with screenshots if possible.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your bug report should also contain your WordPress version and if there are any errors, the <em>exact</em> error text, including line numbers.</p>
<h3>Blank / white screen</h3>
<p>If you're getting a blank screen and you report just that, we can do <em>absolutely</em> nothing. By default, your WordPress install suppresses all errors, to prevent information leaks, but we need those errors to be able to help you. If you apply the small piece of code in <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress-debug/">this post on WP_DEBUG</a> to your site, you should be able to open the URL that gave you a white screen, append <code>?debug=debug</code> to the URL and get the actual error.</p>
<p>That error will help us, without that error, we're completely in the dark about your white page problem...</p>
<h3>Interface errors</h3>
<p>If you're reporting a bug about specific interface elements not working as expected, there's probably an error showing in your browsers JavaScript console. Please open your browsers console and copy the exact error showing there, or make a screenshot. If you don't know how to open your browsers console, here is info for <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/console">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Tools/Web_Console">Firefox</a>. For IE, some Googling will help but it changes with every version.</p>
