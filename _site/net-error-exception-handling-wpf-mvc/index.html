Thousands, if not millions, of exceptions are thrown every day <strong>in production code</strong> without anyone knowing. These errors might be affecting the bottom line, or they could be negligible – either way, it’s important to know that they exist, how often they are occurring, and what parts of the app are affected.</p>
<p>Are you looking for a comprehensive tool that handles logging, reporting, grouping, and notifications for exceptions in your ASP.NET, Web API, WebForms, WPF, Console, MVC, or NancyFX app? Exceptionless does all that, and more. Lets take a look.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Who is Exceptionless for?</h2>
<p>Exceptionless is for developers and dev teams that want to have enhanced visibility of errors, track down bugs faster, tighten up code, and produce a better overall product for the end user.</p>
<p>Currently, the platform is .NET based and has client support for ASP.NET, Web API, WebForms, WPF, Console, MFC, and NancyFX. Soon, we will support clients for Javascript, PHP, Ruby on Rails, Java, Python, and more.

Since then, we’ve had several contributors to the project and more than 50 forks. Pretty exciting stuff!</p>
<p>We offer <strong>extremely reasonable hosting services</strong> for those that would prefer we handle that side of things. The single user, single project hosting account is free, then the small team account starts at $15 per month. Pricing scales from there.
