<h2>Live User Testing Review &amp; Notes</h2>
<p><strong>Our live preview went great! Thank you EVERYONE that sent feedback and comments.</strong></p>
<p>We received some awesome feedback from many of our customers, made some UI/usability tweaks and improvements, and fixed a few minor bugs. We also added the ability to search custom fields, which is a pretty big deal for some.</p>
<p>Naturally, we used Exceptionless 2.0 to log, report on, and gather data for the preview – and it worked amazingly! (shameless, but true, promotion)</p>
<p>On average, we traced <strong>200,000+ anonymous log messages</strong> within the app <strong>each day</strong> from preview activity. That data allowed us to learn a lot more about the behavior of Exceptionless 2.0 in areas such as jobs and gave us additional insight into what was going on. We were able to use a combination of errors, logs, and feature usage metrics to track down and fix an issue with external logins, as well. Awesome!</p>
<p>The system also helped us track down and identify a performance issue that we were able to fix and improve.</p>
<p>Overall, we had no major surprises and were able to tweak and improve several pieces of the app that we think will make it even more awesome.</p>
<h2>Keep The Feedback Coming</h2>
<p>No software application is ever “done,” so make sure to keep the feedback coming. We’ve made a huge leap from Exceptionless 1.x, but we want to keep improving the system in all areas. <strong>We love hearing from our users</strong>, and respond to each email, in-app message, website form submission, etc. So, please, let us know what you think!</p>
