<h1>Want to contribute?</h1>
<p>Did you know that you could be instrumental in making Jetpack more robust and secure? If you use and love Jetpack, why not contribute to the project?</p>
<h2>Contributing for Everyone!</h2>
<p>Whether you can barely recognize a filter (or don’t know what that means) or you’ve already authored your own plugins, there are ways for you to pitch in.</p>
<h3>Beta Testing</h3>
<p>Beta testers give updates, fixes, and new modules a test run before they’re publicly released, so they’re an important part of the development process. If you'd like to join our Beta group, <a href="http://jetpack.me/contact-support/">contact us</a>!</p>
