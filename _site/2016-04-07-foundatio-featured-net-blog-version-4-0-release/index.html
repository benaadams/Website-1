<p><a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/03/29/the-week-in-net-3292016/" target="_blank">Foundatio featured as Project of the Week on .NET Blog</a></p>
<p>We’ve also released V4.0, which has some new implementations, API changes, and, of course, bug fixes.</p>
<p>Check out the details, below.<!--more--></p>
<h2>Foundatio 4.0 Release Notes</h2>
<h3>Implementations</h3>
<p>We’ve got a few new implementations with this release, including Amazon S3 storage, Azure Service Bus queue (thanks <a href="https://github.com/jamie94bc" target="_blank">@jamie94bc!</a>), and Redis metrics client. Users should find those helpful.</p>
<h3>API</h3>
<p>The APIs have been drastically simplified for ease of use and straightforwardness, which should allow for easier creation of new implementations and consumption of existing ones.</p>
<p>Once example of this simplification is that we’ve paired down jobs to having only one lock, instead of four.</p>
<p>Logging has also seen huge improvements to make sure we are aligned with future API implementations, etc.</p>
<h3>Bugs</h3>
<p>More tests have been added since the previous release, and we’ve fixed a few major bugs as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Deadlocks were occurring in a few areas, which is now remedied.</li>
<li>Dropped connections are now automatically healed, while previously we were seeing some issues.</li>
<li>Cached reference types can no longer be updated.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Upgrading to Foundatio 4.0</h2>
<p>If you’re already using Foundatio, simply updated your NuGet package. If you’re new and want to check it out, snag <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio" target="_blank">Foundatio over on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>And, as always, we’re here to answer any questions or take any feedback you might have to offer!</p>
