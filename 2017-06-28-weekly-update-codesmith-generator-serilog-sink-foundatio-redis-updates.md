Blake&#8217;s been busy lately, including some work on one of our other projects, [CodeSmith Generator](http://www.codesmithtools.com/product/generator), to update Exceptionless to the latest version. Naturally, this got him thinking about other potential improvements while we were doing work on Serilog Sink for Exceptionless and Foundatio.Redis, as well.

## CodeSmith Generator Gets Latest Exceptionless Update

While updating our WPF application, [CodeSmith Generator](http://www.codesmithtools.com/product/generator), to the latest version of Exceptionless, Blake brainstorms several improvements that could be madeÂ to help take advantage of plugins, isolate Exceptionless from other plugins, etc.

## Serilog Sink

There was an issue that was breaking the ability to update to the latest version of Exceptionless. This has now been fixed.

## Foundatio.Redis Update

Deserialization wasn&#8217;t working properly with binary serializers, but the issue has been resolved.
