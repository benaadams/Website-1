As you guys know, we've been working on [notification improvements](/email-notification-improvements-walkthrough-and-details/) lately. This latest video update by Blake is no different and involves [Slack](https://slack.com/) integration!<!--more-->

If you're not familiar with Slack, definitely check it out. It's a great app for communicating with your team, and much more. For Exceptionless, it's been something we've wanted to integrate closely with for a while now, because email can be very tedious and overwhelming. With Slack integration, you can set up a specific channel for your Exceptionless notifications to go to, and have an organized eye on your events.

Watch the video above for an explanation of the integration, and see below on how to set it up for yourself.

## Set up Slack Notifications for Exceptionless

First, go into your project's settings in the Exceptionless app and click on the Integrations tab.

Then, click on &#8220;Add Slack Notifications&#8221; and log in to your slack team.

Once logged in, you will need to select the channel you want Exceptionless Notifications to post to and click Authorize.

Once authorized, you can then configure the different notification settings by going back to the Exceptionless app and into the project's integrations tab again.

Once integrated and configured, notifications will look something like the below screenshot, with the message, type of event, stack trace, links to actions, etc.

We're excited to keep improving notifications, and would love for you guys to test this out for us.

Integrations with other chat & productivity tools like Hipchat and Microsoft Teams are on our list, as well, so if you use these please ping us and let us know so we can gauge interest!
