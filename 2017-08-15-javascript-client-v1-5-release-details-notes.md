Exceptionless.JavaScript v1.5 Release Notes

### Unversal App Support

The major update for 1.5 is that we have added support for universal apps (React Universal).

### Other 1.5 Updates

<!--more-->

  * Added support for exceptions that are passed in and are just strings.
  * Updated TraceKit to the latest version, which adds support for parsing PhantomJS errors and greatly improves native stack traces.
  * Thanks [@caesay](https://github.com/caesay) for updating TypeScript to the latest version, as well!

### Bug Fixes

  * Fixed a bug where exceptionless would fail to load when used with webpack.
  * Fixed a bug where browser module info was not being populated.
  * Fixed a bug where ILog.trace was piped to the wrong console function which would error under IE (thanksÂ [@srijken](https://github.com/srijken){.user-mention}!)
  * Fixed a few bugs with angular integration
  * Fixed a bug with submitLog not respecting log message and log level
