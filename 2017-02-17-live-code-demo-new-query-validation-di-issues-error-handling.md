This week&#8217;s live code demo comes to you during a week of final testing and tweaks prior to our [launch of Exceptionless 4.0](https://exceptionless.com/exceptionless-4-0/).

Blake dives into and shows you the code for several important improvements and fixes, which we&#8217;ve listed below.<!--more-->

  * We&#8217;ve added a much improved Query Validator to the repositories and Exceptionless.

  * Some DI issues with running jobs under the debugger have also been fixed.

  * Then, we added error handling around heartbeat submission end points.

  * And finally, an issue where the app would blow up when trying to save invalid reference ids has been fixed.
