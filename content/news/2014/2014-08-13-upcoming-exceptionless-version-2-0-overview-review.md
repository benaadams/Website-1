### New Message Bus & Queueing

In an effort to improve scalability, allow for new functionality to easily be added to Exceptionless, make the system less coupled, process things more efficiently, go fully Async, and further support Azure, we’ve been working hard on a new message bus and queueing system.

### Job System Enhancements

A lot of time has been spent on enhancing the job system behind Exceptionless. From the ability to run jobs standalone, making testing easier, to more ways to run jobs and the ability to auto-scale jobs based on resource constraints, lots of great changes are coming!
