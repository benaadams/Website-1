Thousands, if not millions, of exceptions are thrown every day **in production code** without anyone knowing. These errors might be affecting the bottom line, or they could be negligible &#8211; either way, it's important to know that they exist, how often they are occurring, and what parts of the app are affected.

Are you looking for a comprehensive tool that handles logging, reporting, grouping, and notifications for exceptions in your ASP.NET, Web API, WebForms, WPF, Console, MVC, or NancyFX app? Exceptionless does all that, and more. Lets take a look.<!--more-->

Since then, we've had several contributors to the project and more than 50 forks. Pretty exciting stuff!

We offer **extremely reasonable hosting services** for those that would prefer we handle that side of things. The single user, single project hosting account is free, then the small team account starts at $15 per month. Pricing scales from there.
