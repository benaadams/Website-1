## What's NancyFX?

> "Nancy is a lightweight, low-ceremony, framework for building HTTP based services on .Net and Mono. The goal of the framework is to stay out of the way as much as possible and provide a super-duper-happy-path to all interactions."

* Buit from the ground up (not simply a DSL on another framework)
* Removed underlying framework limitations and feature hacks
* Removed need to reference assemblies you don't need, keeping things light
* Ability to run anywhere, including ASP.NET/IIS, WCF, self hosted, and any OWIN out of the box
* Super lightweight action declarations for GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS and PATCH requests
* View engine integration for Spark, Razor, dotLiquid, SuperSimpleViewEngine, and others
* Request path matching with advanced parameter capabilities, plus the ability to replace the path matching strategy with custom implementations for your needs
* Easy response syntax, enabling you to return things like int, string, HttpStatusCode and Action elements without having to explicitly cast or wrap your response - you just return it and Nancy will do the work for you
* A powerful, light-weight, testing framework to help you verify the behavior of your application
* Content negotiation
* And more...
