The goal was, and still is, to help developers find, track, and squash errors, ultimately creating better code for users.

A few days ago we officially hit **1000 accounts**, and as of today Exceptionless has reported **8,562,499 errors**! We couldn't be more excited!<!--more-->

Sure, we're busier than ever now, answering emails, conversing with open source contributors on new features, and working on new features ourselves, but seeing something grow this quickly, that we've put so much work into, leaves us with little room to complain. The only real thing we can do is say thank you.

## Thanks

We'd like to thank all of our users for using the service, providing feedback, asking the hard questions that make us realize we need to make tweaks here and there, and providing us with direction.

Also, we would specifically like to thank our beta testers that were with us from the beginning. You know who you are, and without you Exceptionless simply would not be the tool it is today.

And, of course, we have to thank everyone that has contributed to and forked the project since [we went open source](/fork-us-exceptionless-goes-open-source/ "Exceptionless Goes Open Source") a few weeks ago. 39 forks, 124 <a title="Exceptionless on GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless" target="_blank">GitHub </a>stars, and a NancyFX client so far - not bad!

## But Wait, There's More!

They say there's no sleep for the wicked, so we're feverishly working on a few major things that will have big long-term benefits for the app.

* Moving to Azure for faster, more robust, scaleable hosting
* Simplifying the API to make it easier for new clients to be implemented and improve metric reporting
* Javascript client

That's just the tip of the iceberg, of course. The to-do list is ever-growing, but we've got to start somewhere.

### Let us know what you think

If you are just now joining the Exceptionless community, let us know what you think. Love it or hate it, we want to know why and how to improve.

Happy bug hunting!
