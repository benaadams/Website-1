Due to growing demand for our hosted error reporting plans, we decided to move everything to the Microsoft Azure Cloud platform.

We completed the move last week and, except for a few small hiccups that were quickly resolved, everything is already running faster across the board!

## Benefits of Azure

### Bring on the errors!

As our user base continues to expand, the first priority is to continue providing the best service possible. Azure allows us to guarantee scalability, and has already proven to beÂ **much** faster and more responsive. We're ready for whatever you can throw at us.

### Focus

Developing infrastructure takes time, and we would rather be developing the code behind Exceptionless. The move to Azure allows us to do just that, taking a lot off our plate in terms of hosting. It's pretty awesome.

### Future Azure partner

In the future, we would like to become an Azure partner and be listed as one of the approved store add-ons. We're not there yet, because we've got to go through the application process, etc, etc, but it's in the works!

> "Azure is an open and flexible cloud platform that enables you to quickly build, deploy and manage applications across a global network of Microsoft-managed datacenters. You can build applications using any language, tool or framework. And you can integrate your public cloud applications with your existing IT environment." - Microsoft Azure

We are happy with the move and think it means great things for the future of Exceptionless. We hope our users appreciate the speed and responsiveness, and can see the improvements in service.
