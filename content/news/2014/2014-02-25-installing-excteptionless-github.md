Since we officially announced that Exceptionless was going open source last week, we wanted to provide everyone with a quick and easy video walkthrough of how to get up and running locally.

It's really quick, as you can see from the below video. Below the video is also a textual walkthrough. Please take a look and let us know if you have any questions.<!--more-->
