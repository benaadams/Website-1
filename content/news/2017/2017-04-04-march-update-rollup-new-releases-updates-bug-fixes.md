## Week of 3/27/2017

### Event metadata archiving, Amazon SQS queus and CloudWatch metrics pull requests, Blake speaks at code camp

* This week we added a setting in Exceptionless for [disabling the archiving of event metadata](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/pull/287)
* For Foundatio, a new pull request was made for Amazon SQS queues and CloudWatch metrics. We've done a lot of work to queues and the message buses to make the constructors have options classes that get passed in. We've also done a lot of work to the Azure implementations to try and optimize them and fix bugs.
* Lastly, Blake spoke at [Northeast Wisconsin Code Camp](http://newcodecamp.com/) over the weekend on exception driven development. [The slides can be found here.](https://github.com/exceptionless/MediaKit/tree/master/presentations/exceptionless)
