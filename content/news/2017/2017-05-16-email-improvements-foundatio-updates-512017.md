## Updates to Exceptionless

In the past few weeks, we have made massive improvements to the daily summary emails, and added support for json-ld. You can keep up with continued email improvements over on [issue 177 on GitHub](https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/issues/177). Let us know what you think there!

We also fixed a bug with the Redis cache client improperly setting batch cached keys.

## Foundatio.Repositories & Foundatio.Parsers Updates

We updated Foundatio.Repositories so that it no longer ignores the version property.

For Foundatio.Parsers, we merged code and server mapping properties.
