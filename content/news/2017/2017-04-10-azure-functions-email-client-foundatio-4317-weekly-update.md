Q2 2017 is here already, whether we are ready for it or not! [In March, we released several new updates to Exceptionless and Foundatio](/march-update-rollup-new-releases-updates-bug-fixes/), so our first update in April isn't crazy, but here we go!<!--more-->

## Exceptionless Updates

* We took some time to look into supporting Azure Functions. <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/pull/293" target="_blank">learn more</a>
* And we received a few pull requests, one of which was for <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/pull/291" target="_blank">updating our email client to support different protocols</a>.

## Foundatio Updates

* This past week, we worked on some bug fixes related to queue processing in Foundatio.
