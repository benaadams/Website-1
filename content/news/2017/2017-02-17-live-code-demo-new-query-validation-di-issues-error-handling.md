This week's live code demo comes to you during a week of final testing and tweaks prior to our [launch of Exceptionless 4.0](/exceptionless-4-0/).

Blake dives into and shows you the code for several important improvements and fixes, which we've listed below.<!--more-->

* We've added a much improved Query Validator to the repositories and Exceptionless.

* Some DI issues with running jobs under the debugger have also been fixed.

* Then, we added error handling around heartbeat submission end points.

* And finally, an issue where the app would blow up when trying to save invalid reference ids has been fixed.
