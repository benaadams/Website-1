In this week'd update, Blake does a little traveling and speaking, and both Exceptionless and Foundatio.Repositories get an update!<!--more-->

## Blake Speaks @ North Dallas .NET

On May 3, Blake spoke at the [North Dallas .NET User Group](http://northdallas.net/) meetup in Plano. The topic was Exception Driven Development, and of course he killed it! Naturally, the Exceptionless love was shared to all.

## Exceptionless & Foundatio.Repositories Updates

For Exceptionless, we worked on upgrading the email templates to use Zurb for emails and handlebars. We also fixed an issue where you could only log in 15 times in a 15 minute time period.

For Foundatio.Repositories, [query if (FieldEqualsIf) support](https://github.com/exceptionless/Foundatio.Repositories/commit/86c1539a9fdb12880db9a4fba1dccdc27055ccea) has been added.
