Bug tracking. Two words that you’ll never be able to escape as a developer. Our goal as developers is to always create a high quality product with pristine code, but let’s face it, nobody’s perfect and accidents happen. Bugs are going to pop up no matter how hard we work or how much we plan ahead. They’re an inevitable part of the job and the more complex your project becomes, the more likely unexpected bugs are to start popping up.<!--more-->

You can try and track these little annoyances manually, like some kind of an animal, or use a bug tracking software to significantly speed up the process and provide a log of what happened and where to prevent future iterations of the same issue.

## WHAT IS BUG TRACKING?

At its core, bug tracking is when a developer tracks, logs, and resolves a bug or issue that caused their software to not perform as intended. This could be as simple as a missing semicolon or trailing slash or as complicated as a vulnerability in your back end. 

In the old days of yesteryear, there weren’t any (good) bug tracking software platforms so developer had to exhaustively QA test their code before publishing and even then, they couldn’t catch everything. Bugs sometimes went to production undetected and they relied on users to report issues so they could investigate them manually later. As you can imagine, this was an incredibly time consuming and tedious process that ate up far too much time and resources that could have been spent developing the next great feature to propel sales.

### IMPORTANCE OF BUG TRACKING

At the risk of sounding pretentious, Kurt Vonnegut said that “Everyone wants to build and nobody wants to do maintenance.” Whether we like it or not, we can’t always build the next big feature or streamline the functionality of our platform. Sometimes we have to hunt down elusive bugs and do maintenance to keep our code clean and keep a solid foundation so we can keep building. 

Ignoring or intentionally leaving bugs to multiply in the code can damage your company’s reputation (and revenue) if one of these errors affects your customers’ ability to do their job or compromises their information. It will save everyone involved a ton of time, money, and headache if you simply implement a bug tracking software from the get go. Your code will stay clean and you’ll stop losing users, leads, and customers. It’s a win / win for everyone.

## ASP.NET FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

ASP.NET is a coding model used to build enterprise class applications with minimal coding. This not only cuts down on the amount of man hours necessary to complete your project, but also simplifies running and maintaining said application due to its (relative) simplicity. If you’re new to the ASP.NET platform, do not be surprised if it’s not the easiest thing to pick up, but once you do, you’ll understand why it’s one of the most popular development platforms out there. (There are a ton of <a href="https://www.asp.net/learn" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tutorials</a> & <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/web/webmatrix/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">learning environments</a> if you’re looking to learn the platform.)

## ASP.NET BUG TRACKING SOFTWARE PLATFORM

Just because ASP.NET is a simplified coding platform doesn’t mean that you won’t have bugs. If anything, it can make them a bit tougher to find, but that’s where having an integrated bug tracking suite comes into play.

Our bug tracking software suite helps development teams find, record, and categorize bugs and errors in real time for your ASP.NET websites, applications, and services. It organizes information in an intuitive and easy to digest dashboard to help your platform become exceptionless.

### REAL TIME BUG DISCOVERY

Bugs can happen anywhere at anytime and if you aren’t watching, they can go unnoticed for months, sometimes years. Our bug tracking software runs in the background of your ASP.net platform 24/7/365 so if something happens, we have a full report with the data you need to craft surgical solution with ease

### DETAILED BUG REPORTS

Once a bug has been discovered and tracked, there’s no need to attempt to replicate the issue. A detailed report is automatically created that intelligently organizes important information to help resolve the bug.

### INTUITIVE ERROR GROUPING

For ease of browsing, our platforms groups errors together based on a variety of criteria, i.e. date, type, platform, browser, etc. to help you drill down and pinpoint the cause of bugs in your application. It also keeps a full history of the exception even after it’s been resolved in case it resurfaces in the future.

### EMAIL NOTIFICATIONS

You no longer have to worry about your customers letting you know about bugs or checking a dashboard every morning. Simply update your notification settings and get instant emails when an error happens, only when new errors happen, or not at all. You can even flag resolved errors to send emails in the event that regress to their previously broken state.

## RECAP

Bugs are an inescapable part of any ASP.NET application, but they don’t have to be an unmanageable nuisance. Implementing an error tracking solution will help you organize bugs as they occur while providing vital information that will help you pinpoint the cause and quickly resolve them. Keep your development teams updating your application with new features with an ASP.NET bug tracking software.
