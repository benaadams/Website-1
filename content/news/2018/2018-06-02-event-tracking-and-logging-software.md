Whether you’re developing a quick module, application, or full blown, go-to-market product, you’re going to need some form of event logging throughout the development process. It can be done without, but you’ll be making your job multiple magnitudes more difficult and losing valuable man hours that could be put towards making your product better instead of just not breaking.<!--more-->

## WHAT IS EVENT LOGGING?

Event logging provides a detailed record of events, bugs, and custom triggers that occur in your application, environment, or product. The information collected gives you a wealth of data to both forensically troubleshoot a bug after it’s occurred as well as proactively to prevent future errors.

This now service is now an invaluable resource to increase your development team’s efficiency and productivity as well as increasing visibility of what goes on behind the scenes in your development environment. On top of that, it also helps maximize application uptime and operation by minimizing the long-term effects of bugs and unwanted events.

### INTUITIVELY PARSE EVENT DATA

Individual raw event logs are too dense and unwieldy to be reviewed. If you were to rely on the raw data, you’d need to specifically hire someone to dig through all that info to pass on the important info to your developers. Event tracking software will parse the data and catalog the important information in an intuitive manner to make everyone’s lives easier. In a nutshell, it will shine a light on the needle in your proverbial haystack.

### FAST AND EASY REPORTING

The great thing about event tracking is that it’s running around the clock. When you and your team aren’t in the office, it’s keeping a watchful eye on your project and collecting data 24/7. It collects data from all sources across your development environment and all of this data is funneled to your dashboard for real-time reporting and criteria based sorting. This allows you to both find the event you’re looking for and quickly dive into its potential causes.

### INTELLIGENT EVENT GROUPING

Exceptionless groups common events into stacks based on where the event occurred and the type of error. This cleans up and consolidates the data on your dashboard and in your reports to keep it from being cluttered as well as keeping that information in a single place for your analysis. Even though the event’s footprint is smaller, you’ll still be able to identify larger iterations of the same event to prioritize your work.

### SAVE TIME ON MAINTENANCE

It can be incredibly difficult to replicate an event that a user encountered. There’s a slew of information you need to accurately track the cause and the user simply may not, or cannot, provide it. You could spends hours or days just trying to isolate what triggered an event. Hours that could have been put towards building a new feature or getting your product to market.

Event tracking software makes it so a bug that once took a week to find can be found, patched, and pushed live in a matter of minutes or hours instead of days or weeks. Spend less time on maintenance and more time innovating.

### EVENT LOGGING SOFTWARE PAYS FOR ITSELF

Your developers’ time is valuable, and expensive. Even though it’s important, having them blindly diving down rabbit holes to chase bugs and other events can be incredibly costly and not productive. Not every project has a big budget and you may have to work faster and more efficiently to wrap it up without going over budget. While an event logging software may sound like an additional expense, the amount of time you save troubleshooting and fixing bugs will easily cover the cost. And the great thing is, the more you use it, the more you save.

### USER FRIENDLY DASHBOARD

All the information in the world won’t help you if it’s impossible to dig through. We specifically built our dashboard to give a clear high level view of your application while still being clear the further you drill down into individual events and bugs. You can quickly view the health of your application, track data from actually users, and intelligently drill down into recent errors. It seamlessly unites metrics and productivity while you analyze and explore data to rapidly troubleshoot your application.
