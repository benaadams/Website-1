**Last week, Elasticsearch <a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/being-exceptionless-with-elasticsearch" target="_blank">published that case study on their blog</a>**, so we wanted to make sure our readers had a chance to check it out!

We've written about our use of Elasticsearch in numerous articles before, including:<!--more-->

* [Making the Move to Elasticsearch for Exceptionless 2.0](/making-move-elastic-search-exceptionless-2-0/)
* [Filter Your Exceptions in Version 2.0 &#8211; Video Demo](/filter-your-exceptions-video-demo/)
* [Exceptionless V3.0 &#8211; Changes to the Build Process, Dependencies, and Self Hosting](/exceptionless-3-0-changes-to-build-process-dependencies-self-hosting/)
* [Exceptionless 3.1 Released! If You Thought It was Fast Before&#8230;](/exceptionless-3-1-released-if-you-thought-it-was-fast-before/)

**In the case study**, we discuss how Elasticsearch let us improve our real-time dashboard, work with time zones more easily, index data much faster, not have to worry so much about pre-aggregating data, maintain much less code, improve backup and restoration, shrink disk space usage, and, perhaps most importantly, drastically improve scalability.

Basically, **we really like Elasticsearch** and you should check it out if you haven't already.
