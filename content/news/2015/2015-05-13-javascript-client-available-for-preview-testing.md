## Exceptionless JavaScript Client Overview

The client supports Node.js and JavaScript, and you can find up-to-date installation, configuration, and usage documentation over on the <a title="Exceptionless JavaScript Client GitHub" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a>.

Just like the non-JavaScript client, unhandled exceptions will be automatically sent upon configuration, and you can send log messages, feature usage events, etc. All the normal Exceptionless functionality is available.

## Wanted!

Testers, developers, contributors, and feedback wanted! We want to make the Exceptionless JavaScript client **awesome**, but we need your help. Give us any feedback you might have via <a title="GitHub Exceptionless JavaScript Issues" href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless.JavaScript/issues" target="_blank">GitHub</a> an in-app message, [contact form](/contact/ "Contact Exceptionless") submission, or comment right here on this blog post. We're more than happy to answer any and all questions, or help you get up and running.
