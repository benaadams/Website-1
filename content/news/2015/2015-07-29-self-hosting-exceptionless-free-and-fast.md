**Self hosting allows you to run your own instance of <a href="/" target="_blank">Exceptionless</a>, our real-time error, feature, and log reporting tool, on your own systems &#8211; FOR FREE!**

## Not Just Free, but Fast!

When developing <a href="/exceptionless-3-0-changes-to-build-process-dependencies-self-hosting/" target="_blank">Exceptionless 3.0</a>, we put extensive focus on making self hosting much easier, and therefore more viable, for our users.

It is now possible to get a test environment up and running on your local machine in **only a few minutes**, and production environments can be set up very quickly as well.

Getting your self hosted instance of Exceptionless up and running is super easy. In the video below, Blake does the entire install on his local machine and is sending events to Exceptionless in **less than 2 minutes!**

Please note that you should review the requirements on the <a href="https://github.com/exceptionless/Exceptionless/wiki/Self-Hosting" target="_blank">Self Hosting Documentation</a> page before installing your own instance.
