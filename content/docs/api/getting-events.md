## Get Event by Reference ID

If we want to get the event we just created by itâ€™s reference_id, we can navigate to `Event` > `GET /api/v2/events/by-ref/{referenceId}`, enter that reference ID, and get back the details of the event.

## Get Event via Search Filter

Another example of getting an event may include using the reference ID or another search filter we just created and getting all by a reference filter. You can use any search filter in the filter parameter.

To do so, navigate to `Event` > `GET /api/v2/events` and use the reference term to filter events by the reference ID.
